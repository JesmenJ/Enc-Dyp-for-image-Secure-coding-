# Image Encryption-Decryption Tool

![Image Encryption Tool] 

## Introduction
The **Image Encryption-Decryption Tool** is a Python-based GUI application designed for secure image processing. This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using randomly generated Gaussian noise as a key. Encrypted images become unintelligible, and can only be restored to their original form using the same key.

## Features
- **Select Images:** Load images from your local file system.
- **Encrypt Images:** Apply visual encryption using random Gaussian keys.
- **Decrypt Images:** Restore the original image using the encryption key.
- **Reset Images:** Reload the original image.
- **Save Images:** Save the encrypted or decrypted image to a desired location.
- **Exit Application:** Safely close the application with confirmation.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL)

  ```bash
  pip install pillow
  ```

- OpenCV

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- NumPy

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JesmenJ/Enc-Dyp-for-image-Secure-coding-
   cd Enc-Dyp-for-image-Secure-coding-
   ```

2. **Run the Python Script:**
   ```bash
   python image_encryption.py
   ```

3. **Use the Application:**
   - Click **"Choose"** to select an image from your local machine.
   - Click **"Encrypt"** to encrypt the image.
   - Click **"Decrypt"** to decrypt the image.
   - Click **"Reset"** to reload the original image.
   - Use **"Save"** to store the encrypted or decrypted image.
   - Exit the application using the **"EXIT"** button or close the window.

## GUI Overview
- **Original Image Panel:** Displays the original image.
- **Encrypted-Decrypted Image Panel:** Shows the encrypted or decrypted version.

### Buttons:
- **Choose:** Load an image.
- **Encrypt:** Encrypt the selected image.
- **Decrypt:** Decrypt the encrypted image.
- **Reset:** Reload the original image.
- **Save:** Save the modified image.
- **EXIT:** Close the application.

## Code Structure
- **image_encryption.py:** Main Python script with GUI logic and encryption-decryption functionality.
- **image_encrypted.jpg:** Temporarily stores encrypted images during execution.
- **image_output.jpg:** Temporarily stores decrypted images during execution.

## How Image Encryption Works
1. The image is converted to grayscale.
2. A Gaussian noise matrix is generated as the encryption key.

### Encryption Formula:
\[ \text{image\_encrypted} = \text{image\_input} \times \text{key} \]

### Decryption Formula:
\[ \text{image\_output} = \text{image\_encrypted} \times \text{key} \]

## Known Issues and Limitations
- Works only with grayscale images.
- The encryption key is stored in memory and lost if the program crashes.
- The application doesnâ€™t handle color images (RGB channels need separate encryption).
- If the encrypted image is modified externally, decryption may fail.

## Future Improvements
- Support for color image encryption (handling RGB channels).
- Persistent key management to avoid key loss.
- Enhanced security with AES or RSA encryption.
- Add drag-and-drop support for faster image selection.
